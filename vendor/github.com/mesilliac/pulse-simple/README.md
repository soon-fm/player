pulse-simple
============

Cgo bindings to PulseAudio's Simple API,
for easily playing or capturing raw audio.

The full Simple API is supported,
including channel mapping and setting buffer attributes.

usage
-----

Basic usage is to request a playback or capture stream,
then write bytes to or read bytes from it.

Reading and writing will block until the given byte slice
is completely consumed or filled, or an error occurs.

The format of the data will be as requested on stream creation.

For example,
assuming "data" contains raw bytes representing stereophonic audio
in little-endian 16-bit integer PCM format,
the following will obtain a playback stream
and play the given data as audio on the default sound device.

    ss := pulse.SampleSpec{pulse.SAMPLE_S16LE, 44100, 2}
    stream, _ := pulse.Playback("my app", "my stream", &ss)
    defer stream.Free()
    defer stream.Drain()
    stream.Write(data)

More example usage can be found in the examples folder.
